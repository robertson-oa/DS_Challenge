# 2019 Ford Gobike System Data Exploration and Visualization

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area which has about 500,0000 rides since it launch in 2017. The dataset is in csv format downloaded from the udacity classroom. <a href = 'https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1658999769730737&usg=AOvVaw1YaxqLLA2FiNFe9vbI4-gS'>Download here</a>.  
Visualization are created from preliminary wrangling and cleaning process to facilitate exploration analysis to discover usage pattern.

## Summary of Findings

The most trips peaked around 8-7 in the morning and 5-6 in the evening, there were more trips on work days as compared to weekends. The riding trips tend to be shorter on work days as compared to weekends. It indicates a pretty stable and efficient usage of the bike sharing system on normal work days, while more casual use on weekends.

Most riders were male subscribers who did not use bike share for all trips. Most members can be classified as young as they ere between the ages 25 to 40 years old, as the age gets older, bike usage dropped significantly. Though not a huge difference, male riders tend to have shorter trips compared to female users, indicated by both a smaller median and shorter inter quartile range. Riders who rented the bikes Monday through Friday are slightly older than those who ride on weekends, which supplements the work purpose usage that was observed from some of the univariable exploration plots.

There are a lot more subscriber usage than customers overall. The riding habit varies a lot between subscribers and customers. Subscribers use the bike sharing system for work purpose and especially during rush hours (when going to work in the morning and getting off work in the afternoon), whereas customers tend to ride for fun in the afternoon or early evenings over weekends. Subscriber usage peaks out on typical rush hours when people go to work in the morning and getting off work in the afternoon, which strengthened their usage purpose and goal of riding. Similar pattern was not observed among customers who tend to ride most in the afternoon or early evening for a different purpose than the subscribers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Different usage pattern between the two type of riders are seen from the exploration. Subscribers use the system heavily on work days i.e. Monday through Friday whereas customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon. Many trips concentrated in the morning and evenings thus 8-7am and 5-6pm on work days for subscribers, yet customers tend to use more in the late afternoon around 5 in the evening on Monday to Friday. The efficient period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work purpose. The more relaxing and flexible pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system quite differently from the subscribers, heavily over weekends and in the afternoon, probably for leisure.
